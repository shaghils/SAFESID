# SAFESIDE
SafeSide: An app for preventing cancer by encouraging healthy habits and detecting people who have a risk of developing cancer, based on a few questions related to lifestyle and family history. 

The app contains three main features starting with the feature of tracking preventative habits which creates the urge to maintain a healthy lifestyle and can prevent users from developing cancer. It uses gamification to encourage people to practice healthy habits by creating a leaderboard to compare their progress with their peers. 

The app also has some basic risk detection tests which take some answers which are weighted differently for different parameters based on previous research and can give an estimate on how prone could the user be based on the answers. Although the results could not be 100% accurate, they can provide an estimate of the risk of developing cancer, based on answers about the user's lifestyle.

The app also records any health abnormalities that a user encounters in their daily life. The daily logged records could be shared with their doctors which could help in the early detection of any disease.
The data collected from the app could also be used to improve the accuracy of early cancer detection models.

The app also displays a new cancer-preventive health tip on the home screen every day.
We believe that the SafeSide app would enable its users to be on the safe side.  
The app works and looks best when accessing it from mobile devices. (We used a mobile-first approach for developing it.)
The source code and demo link for the app have been made available. 

The complete source code for this project is in the folder named "SafeSide1.0.2"
