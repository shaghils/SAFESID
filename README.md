# SAFESIDE
SafeSide: An app for preventing cancer by encouraging healthy habits and detecting people who have a risk of developing cancer, based on a few questions related to lifestyle and family history. 
The app contains three main features starting with the feature of tracking preventative habits which creates the urge to maintain a healthy lifestyle and can prevent users from developing cancer. It uses gamification to encourage people to practice healthy habits by creating a leaderboard to compare progress with their peers. 
The app also has some basic risk detection tests which take some answers which are weighed for different parameters and can give an estimate on how prone could the user be based on the answers. Although the results could not be100% accurate, they can provide an estimate of the risk of cancer, based on answers about the user's lifestyle.
The app also records any health abnormalities that a user encounters in their daily life. The records could be shared with their doctors which could help in the early detection of any disease.
The data collected from the app could also be used to improve the accuracy of early cancer detection models.
We believe that the SafeSide app would enable its users to be on the safe side.
